# ML_Tradebot
Binance Testnet Tradebot with Machine Learning

This Github contains the code for our machine-learning tradebot. Our final solution is built in Python Dash and is fully interactive, however, due to Binance.com API rules it does require a VPN to run (this rule was implemented by Binance during the course of our capstone projet).

The folder structure inside has been documented below.
